This repository contains my **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** on the classic [Titanic Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic) as part of my **internship with Elevvo**.


Project Description
The Titanic dataset is a well-known dataset for learning **data analysis** and **machine learning**.  
In this project, I performed EDA to explore survival patterns among passengers and uncover meaningful insights.

Steps Covered
-  Data Cleaning: handled missing values, converted data types  
-  Feature Engineering: created Family Size, IsAlone, Age Groups, Titles  
-  Summary Statistics: survival rates by gender, class, age group, and title  
-  Data Visualization: bar plots, KDE distributions, and heatmaps  

 Key Insights
-  **Females** had significantly higher survival rates than males  
-  **1st Class passengers** had the highest survival chances compared to 2nd and 3rd  
-  **Children** (under 12) had better survival rates than adults  
-  Passenger **titles** (Miss, Mrs, Rare) and **family size** influenced survival  

Tools & Libraries
- Python 
- Pandas  
- NumPy  
- Seaborn  
- Matplotlib
